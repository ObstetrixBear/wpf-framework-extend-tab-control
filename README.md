# Extended WPF TabControl for C# .NET Framework
A demonstration of how to extend a TabControl with an extra WPF element.

## What this is
At work, I had a tab-control. In it, I needed to display a message between the Tab Header field and the Content. This is my solution.

## Details
I'm not used to data-binding and Windows style programming. In fact, I'm pretty sure this code would be blindingly obvious to any seasoned WPF veteran. But since extending classes (in what I suppose must be called the Microsoft idiom) appears to be how WPF is meant to work, and it was nonobvious to me, I thought it could be helpful to put this code online in case someone had the same issue I had, or in case I needed to repeat it at a later date. 

Have a look if you like, and if you should find something wrong or an area where it could be improved, please let me know.
