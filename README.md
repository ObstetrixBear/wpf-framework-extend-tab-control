# Extended WPF TabControl for C# .NET Framework
A demonstration of how to extend a TabControl with an extra WPF element.

## What this is
At work, I had a tab-control. In it, I needed to display a message between the Tab Header field and the Content. This is my solution.

## Details
I'm not a WPF expert, so I'm pretty sure this is what anyone more skilled than I would be able to accomplish. Since extending classes (in what I suppose must be called the Microsoft idiom) appears to be how WPF is meant to work, I thought it might be helpful to put this code online in case I have to do something similar at a later date. 

I hope it will prove useful to others, as well. Have a look if you like, and if you should find something wrong or suboptimal, please let me know.
